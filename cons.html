            <h2>Overstimulation & Distractions</h2>
            <p> On the flip side, dopamine can crack the noise dial and drown out focus. Every ping, reel, and shiny tab
                whispers, &quot;maybe there&#39;s something better to do right now&quot;. That constant &quot;maybe&quot; fragments 
                attention into confetti. Your brain learns to expect tiny jackpots, not deep work. Soon, silence feels itchy 
                and you reach for another hit. It&#39;s not a moral failure, but instead an incentive system that is mis-tuned. 
                If everything is urgent and delightful, nothing gets depth. </p>

            <h2> Reward Loops & Cravings </h2>
            <p> Reward loops happen when quick hits outcompete slow goals. Scroll, snack, buy, repeat. The cycle promises itself. 
                It is the &quot;go get it&quot; push, so the chase can outrun the payoff. Your brain learns the pattern and starts craving
                the cue, not the result. Triggers can pile up and you only start with a certain amount of dopamine every day, so it
                is important to recognize bad habits. Habits become auto before you even begin to notice. The loop isn't you being
                weak, but instead it&#39;s efficient wiring doing its job a little too well. </p>
