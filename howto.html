            <h2> When I Am Down Bad </h2>
            <p> When I am aleady stuck in a loop, I try to shrink the battlefield and change one link in the chain.
                Removing or delaying the cue has helped me with staying locked in on a task. This could be in the 
                form of, but not limited to, removing applications, putting my phone far away, or setting an alarm, 
                all with the purpose of creating speed bumps for my impulses. Swapping the behavior with something 
                taking a walk or standing up to stretch or anything that end with &quot;done&quot; has helped me with the 
                doomscrolling and potato moments. Tricking a single streak so that wins become visible fuel will 
                help you realign your dopamine&#39;s targets. </p>

            <h2> When Im Up </h2>
            <p> When I am not in a loop, building guardrails before I actually need them helps a lot from going back 
                to the bad habits. Pre-planning windows for "fun hits" and keeping them contained, like dessert after 
                dinner. Keeping goals bite-sized helps so that success can land daily and momentum never runs cold.
                Celebrate finishes on purpose so that your brain learns that completion, not distraction, is where the
                bread and butter lives. Future you will thank the past you for making the default path the right one. </p>
