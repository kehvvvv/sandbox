            <h2>Motivation and Momentum</h2>
            <p> Dopamine is the spark that turns motivation into motion. It nudges you from &quot;I should&quot; to
                &quot;I&#39;m doing it.&quot; Think of it as your brain&#39;s little pat on the back each time you take
                a micro step. When you set a tiny goal and accomplish it, your dopamine says, $quot;nice&quot; and momentum
                snowballs. That&#39;s why streaks, checklists, and progress bars feel strangely helpful and powerful. The
                trick is sizing your goals so wins arrive fast enough to keep your engine humming. Too big of a hit and you
                may stall, but too small of a hit could also result in you getting bored. Aim for a just the right amount
                and ride the chemistry forward. </p>

            <h2>Using Dopamine to Learn</h2>
            <p> Dopamine also helps wire in new skills because it flags moments as &quot;worth remebering&quot;.Novelty, small wins, and
                timely feedback all boost that signal. Break study or practice into short reps that end with a tiny success, and
                your brain goes, &quot;write that down WRITE THAT DOWN!&quot;. Pair effort with immediate cues, such as code that runs or 
                notes that click, so that learning pays off right away. Variety can also help you use dopamine to learn. Switch
                up problems, change mediums, or teach a friend to keep things fresh in your mind. Learning sticks when effort
                and reward stay in tight conversation. </p>
